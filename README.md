# Creating my First React App: TicTacToe 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
(Work in Progress)

## Features of this App:

React-powered UI: A dynamic and efficient user interface powered by React.js.
Two-player Mode: Challenge a friend to a match on the same device.
Responsive Design: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices for gaming on-the-go.
Game State Management: Real-time game state handling and update functionality powered by React's state and props.
Minimalistic and Clean Design: Styled with custom CSS for a simple yet modern aesthetic.

### Tech Stack:

React.js: For building the interactive user interface.
JavaScript: Core functionality and game logic.
HTML & CSS: For structuring and styling the app.

### How to Play:

Choose your side (X or O).
Take turns placing your mark on the 3x3 grid.
The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
The game will automatically detect a win or a tie and reset the board for a new round.

### How to Run the App:


Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe.git

Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:
cd tic-tac-toe
npm install

Start the development server:
