1. Overview of Project Structure
The project is organized with a functional component named TicTacToe, which contains all necessary state and methods to handle the game logic, user interactions, and UI updates. Here’s how each component and method is structured:

Imports: Imports React hooks (useState, useRef, useEffect), CSS file for styling, and images for X and O symbols.
Component Layout: The TicTacToe board is created using div elements, and the game’s state and actions are managed within this component.

2. Key States and Variables
Game States:
count: Tracks the number of turns.
lock: Disables further moves after a win or draw.
data: Holds the board data, an array of 9 strings that are either empty, "x", or "o."
isDarkMode: Toggles between dark and light themes.
isGameOver: Indicates whether the game has ended (win or tie).
winningCombination: Stores the indices of boxes that form a winning combination.
Refs:
titleRef: References the title element to dynamically update the winner message.
boxRefs: An array of refs for each box to control individual box updates.
timeoutRef: Holds timeout ID for automatic reset.

4. Workflow and Methods
useEffect
Purpose: This hook updates each box in the grid based on the data array and applies winning styles to the appropriate boxes.
Behavior: Runs whenever data, isGameOver, or winningCombination change.
Auto-reset Logic: If isGameOver is true, a timeout is set to call resetGame after 5 seconds, and it’s cleared on component unmount.
toggle(e, num)
Purpose: Handles the player’s move.
Logic:
Checks if the game is locked or if the selected box is already filled.
Updates the data array with either "x" or "o" based on the current turn (count).
Increments count to switch turns.
Calls checkWinner to evaluate if there’s a winning combination.
checkWinner(currentData)
Purpose: Checks for a winning condition or a tie.
Logic:
Contains an array of possible winning combinations.
Loops through each combination, checking if the same symbol is present in each box of a combination.
Calls won if a winning combination is found or displays "Tie" if there’s no empty space left.
won(winner, combo)
Purpose: Handles the end-of-game actions when there’s a winner.
Logic:
Locks the game by setting lock to true.
Stores the winning combination in winningCombination to apply styling.
Updates the title with a winning message.
Sets isGameOver to true to trigger auto-reset.
resetGame
Purpose: Resets the game to its initial state.
Logic:
Unlocks the game, clears the board, resets count, removes winning styles, and updates the title to default.
toggleDarkMode
Purpose: Toggles between dark and light modes for the board.
Logic: Uses isDarkMode to apply the correct theme class to the container.
5. Component Return (UI Structure)
Container and Title: A div element styled based on isDarkMode, with a title displaying “Tic-Tac-Toe.”
Board Layout:
Organized as a 3x3 grid with boxes, each being a clickable div that references the toggle function and changes class if it contains "x" or "o."
Buttons:
"Play Again" button that calls resetGame.
"Dark Mode" button that toggles between dark and light mode.
6. CSS Styling
Classes: CSS is used to define styles for dark-mode, light-mode, winning-box, tie-message, and other interactive states to create a visually appealing UI.
Presentation Outline
Introduction: Brief on React functional components and state management.
Game State Management: Explanation of the useState and useRef variables, emphasizing modularity and separation of concerns.
Game Logic: Walk through toggle, checkWinner, and won to explain the game’s turn-based logic and win/tie conditions.
UI Updates: Discuss how useEffect updates the UI dynamically in response to state changes.
Auto-reset and Dark Mode: Highlight auto-reset functionality and dark mode toggle to enhance user experience.
Final Look: Quick demo of the TicTacToe board with gameplay, reset, and theme toggling.
This workflow breaks down the development process of the TicTacToe app and demonstrates how React hooks and methods help manage game state, UI interactions, and responsiveness effectively.
